  <h1> Changes </h1>

  <p>
The bulk of chapter 8 discussed time series charts. The element of these charts that are differnt from those discussed in chapter 7 are the time aspect. One of the axis are measuring time in the time series chart. If you're not careful, the graph can be misleading when there is data missing or if you're not careful with the time intervals. 
  This is different than chapter 7 because every single data set for chapter 8 had the added component of change over time. 
Chapter 7 only generally discussed what a distribution was and how we could describe them.

  Seasonal Subseries Chart
  Pro: Can be used to compare data change both the month by month. This is helpful for data that varies greatly from season to season. 
  Con: Can be hard to read when trying to compare the overall year to year changes.

  2. Indexes
  Pro: It is easy to spot overall pattern change over time.
  Con: Percentage calculations are being used so if you need raw data and not overall trends this graph is not very helpful.

  Pro: They are fun to look at and space efficient.
  Con: Can be hard to read when there is a large data set for the other variable that is not time.
